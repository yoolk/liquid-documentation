### **{% raw %}{{ content_for_header }}{% endraw %} and {% raw %}{{ content_for_layout }}{% endraw %}**

There are two Liquid objects that are required in theme-name.liquid:

* The _{% raw %}{{ content_for_header }}{% endraw %}_ variable must be placed between the opening and closing <head> tag. It inserts the necessary Yoolk Liquid scripts into the <head> which includes scripts for Google Analytics, SEO meta tags, CSRF meta tag, and more.

* The _{% raw %}{{ content_for_layout }}{% endraw %}_ variable must be placed between the opening and closing <body> tag. It outputs dynamic content generated by all of the other templates (index.liquid, product.liquid, etc.).

* The _{% raw %}{{ content_for_closing_body }}{% endraw %}_ variable must be placed before the closing body (</body>) tag. It inserts the scripts\' tags below:
  * google remarketing code
  * google conversion code (Page Load)


The `layouts/<theme-name>.liquid` can be thought of as the master template; all other templates are rendered inside of `layouts/<theme-name>.liquid`. Any elements that are repeated in a theme (ex: site navigations, header, footer, etc.) should be placed inside `layouts/<theme-name>.liquid`.

![layouts]({{ '/images/theme-templates/contact-us-index.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
